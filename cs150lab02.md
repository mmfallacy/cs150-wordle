1. How did you find the exercise in terms of enjoyment, ease, learning, usefulness, etc.?
   - I enjoyed the exercise a lot especially since I went all in and tried to make something a bit more complex. I appreciate how easy and practical the lab exercise is hence I took my time and tried to actually learn something off of it.
2. How long did it take you to finish each item?
   - Specific to my implementation, it took me 2 hours to collectively write the opinionated way of defining components and pages and to use it while making the Keyboard component
   
   - Everything else was made in approx 3 hours with an hour spent tweaking things to adhere to the given spec.
3. How could this exercise be improved?
   - Could be improved by making a full blown game on a framework like Svelte. Using frameworks would promote something closer to what the industry expects (code-splitting, etc.).
